          <p>
            üëã "Hello World!" I'm Ye Moe.
            <br /><br />
            I'm a passionate and enthusiastic Junior Software Engineer with a
            strong interest in full-stack development, artificial intelligence,
            and building impactful software solutions. I'm driven by a desire to
            create user-focused applications that combine clean design with
            smooth functionality. Technology excites me not just as a career,
            but as a tool for shaping the future ‚Äî and I constantly seek out
            opportunities to grow, learn, and challenge myself. Outside of
            coding, I enjoy reading, watching films, and exploring new places.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            üõ†Ô∏è Skills and Experience
            <br /><br />
            I'm proficient in Python, C++, PHP, and SQL, and am currently diving
            deeper with React, Flask, and cloud-based platforms. I treat every
            project as a learning opportunity and take pride in
            problem-solving‚Äîfrom debugging the small stuff to architecting
            bigger systems. My resume further reflects my expanding skillset and
            hands-on experience across both academic and real-world settings.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            üöÄ What I'm Working On
            <br /><br />
            I currently work as an College Assistant at BMCC's Admissions
            Office, where I guide students through the admissions and transfer
            process. Previously, I interned at BMCC's STEM Innovation Hub,
            collaborating with mentors from Columbia University and JP Morgan on
            solutions to support student success.
            <br /><br />
            In January 2023, I was hired by Teromac Technologies as a Junior
            Software Engineer to help develop an e-commerce webapp for their
            clients. Incorporating MERN tools, ADA compliance and security
            measures, I collaborated with a small team under the guidance of
            their senior developers. That same year, I participated in a
            Google-sponsored BMCC hackathon where my team placed 2nd, which led
            to a networking visit to Google NYC ‚Äî an inspiring milestone in my
            journey. These experiences continue to shape my drive to create,
            build, and grow.
            <br /><br />
            I'm currently working on personal projects that reflect my journey
            as a developer ‚Äî projects that not only demonstrate technical skills
            but also my passion for user experience and thoughtful design.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            üìö Always Learning
            <br /><br />
            I'm currently a Junior pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at Baruch
            College, Weissman School of Arts and Sciences. Staying current with
            emerging technologies is a top priority for me. Whether it's
            learning a new framework or refining my fundamentals, I aim to stay
            adaptable, forward-thinking, and curious.
          </p>

          <p>
            üì´ Connect with me
            <br /><br />
            Let's stay connected! I'm always open to collaboration, mentorship,
            and new opportunities. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or
            reach out if you have a project in mind, an idea worth exploring, or
            just want to chat about tech. I'd love to hear from you!
